Here's what each piece means:

ASM=nasm, ASMFLAGS=-f elf64, LD=ld: These lines set variables for the assembler, the assembler flags, and the linker respectively.

%.o: %.asm: This line defines a pattern rule. It tells make how to build .o files from .asm files. The % acts as a wildcard, matching filenames without the extension.

$(ASM) $(ASMFLAGS) -o $@ $<: This is the command that gets executed to build .o files from .asm files. $@ is the target (the .o file), and $< is the dependency (the .asm file).

program: main.o lib.o: This specifies that the target program depends on main.o and lib.o. When you run make program, it will make sure main.o and lib.o are up to date before building program.

$(LD) -o $@ $^: This command links main.o and lib.o to produce program. $@ is the target (program), and $^ are all the prerequisites (main.o and lib.o).

.PHONY: clean: .PHONY indicates that clean is not a file target and should always be executed, even if a file named clean exists.

clean:: This is a target for cleaning up the build. It removes all .o files.

rm *.o: This command deletes all .o files in the directory.

So, if you run make program, it will compile main.asm and lib.asm to main.o and lib.o respectively, then link them to create program. If you run make clean, it will remove all .o files.
